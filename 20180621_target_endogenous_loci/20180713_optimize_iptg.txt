1. Start overnight cultures of lz/on and lz/off.

2. Prepare media (EZ + Carb + Chlor + ATC) with 
   concentrations of IPTG from 4 mM to 125 µM:

    - Put 2 mL media in wells A1, B1 of a 24-well 
      block.
    - Put 1 mL media in wells A2-A6, B2-B6, C6, D6
    - Add 4 µL 1M IPTG to wells A1, B1
    - Perform a serial dilution in rows A and B, 
      transfering 1 mL on each step.

3. Inoculate each well with 4 µL overnight culture:

    - Row A,C: lz/on
    - Row B,D: lz/off

4. Grow at 37°C for 8h.

5. Measure β-galactosidase activity:

    - Thaw 2X β-Galactosidase Assay Buffer on ice.

    - Mix 800 µL of this assay buffer with an equal 
      volume of Y-PER Reagent to make the working 
      solution (WS). Each well requires 100 µL of the 
      WS, and I have 15 wells (2 guides × 7 IPTG 
      concentrations + 1 blank), so I need 1500 µL, 
      plus some extra.  The maximum culture volume 
      allowed per well is 100 µL.

    - Determine the OD660 of all test cultures and 
      record values. Include one well that contains 
      growth media only (no cells) as a blank for the 
      spectrophotometer.

    - Add 100 µL of each culture to the wells.

    - Use a timer to monitor the reaction. Apply 100 
      µL of the WS to each well and start timer.

    - Incubate the plate at room temperature for 
      approximately 30 minutes.

    - Use the well containing medium only (no cells) 
      to zero the instrument.  Measure the absorbance 
      at 420nm of each well.
