Day 1
=====
- Prepare 120 mL 1M sorbitol:

  - 21.86 g sorbitol
  - water to 120 mL
   
- Reserve 5 mL 1M sorbitol (in a 15 mL falcon tube)

- Prepare 115 mL "electroporation buffer" with the 
  remaining 1M sorbitol:

  - 115 mL 1M sorbitol
  - 115 uL 1M CaCl2
  - sterile filter

- Chill the following reagents overnight in the cold 
  room:

  - 5 50 mL pipets
  - 1 box 1000 uL pipet tips
  - 200 mL milliQ water
  - 115 mL "electroporation buffer"

- Start a 12 mL overnight culture in YPD from a fresh 
  colony.

Day 2
=====
- Inoculate 400 mL YPD with all of the overnight 
  culture.  The OD should be near 0.3.  
   
- Incubate the cells at 30°C with shaking at 225 rpm 
  in a 1L baffled flask until they reach OD 1.6.  
  This should take about 5h.

- Setup a NotI digestion to linearize 80 μg of your 
  library.

  We're doing 10 transformations, and the actual 
  insert is only about half of the plasmid, so this 
  corresponds to 4 μg/rxn.  Benatuil tested insert 
  concentrations from 4 μg/rxn to 16 μg/rxn and found 
  that they all gave similar transformation 
  efficiencies, so we're sticking to the low end of 
  that range.

  Reagent             Conc       Vol
  ──────────────────────────────────
  Water                     to 20 uL
  Plasmid DNA                  80 μg
  CutSmart Buffer      10x      2 μL
  NotI             20 U/μL      2 μL

  - Incubate 1h at 37°C, then 20 min at 65°C, then 
    hold at 12°C.

- Once the NotI digestion is complete, desalt the DNA 
  using drop dialysis.

  - Fill a petri dish about halfway (~20 mL) with 
    milliQ water.

  - Float a nitrocellulose membrane shiny-side up on 
    the water.  Use tweezers to handle the membrane 
    and make sure no air gets caught underneath it.  

    The reason for having the shiny-side up is 
    explained on the Millipore website.  It's 
    helpful but not crucial, so don't worry if you 
    can't really tell which side is the shiny one:

      Most researchers may not even notice that 
      there is a "sidedness" to filters, and, for 
      most applications, orientation will not affect 
      filter performance.  However, membranes do 
      have a slightly asymmetric pore structure: the 
      shiny side of the membrane is the "tighter" 
      side.  In some applications, you can take 
      advantage of this difference by selecting a 
      specific filter orientation.  Membranes should 
      always be used shiny side up for drop dialysis 
      (a buffer exchange technique in which a few 
      drops of DNA or protein are placed in a 0.05 
      or 0.025 um filter and floated on a buffer 
      solution).  Apply the sample to the shiny side 
      of the filter and float the filter dull side 
      to the buffer.  This measure will enhance 
      buffer exchange and discourage sample loss.  

  - Let the membrane sit for 5 min to allow it to 
    completely soak with water.

  - Pipet the entire NotI digestion reaction (20 uL) 
    onto the center of the membrane.

  - Dialyze for 4h.

  - Pipet the droplet off the membrane and into a 
    clean tube.
   
- Prepare 20 mL "conditioning buffer":

  - 2 mL 1M LiOAc
  - 200 μL 1 M DTT
  - water to 20 mL
  
- Wash the cells:

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL chilled water.

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL chilled water again.

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL "electroporation buffer".

  - Pellet 3270g, 4°C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 20 mL "conditioning buffer".
  
- Incubate the cells at 30°C for 30 min with shaking 
  at 225 rpm.

- Prepare 10 mL "recovery media":

  - 5 mL YPD
  - 5 mL 1M sorbitol
  - Sterile filter using a syringe.
  - Pre-warm to 30°C.

- Make 10 aliquots of DNA (the volume of the DNA 
  changes during dialysis), then chill the DNA on ice 
  along with 10 electroporation cuvettes (with 2 mm 
  gaps).

- Wash the cells again:

  - Pellet 3270g, 4C, 5 min.
  - Resuspend in 50 mL "electroporation buffer".

  - Pellet 3270g, 4C, 5 min.
  - Add "electroporation buffer" to a final volume 
    of 4 mL.

- Pipet once to mix 400 uL of cells with each aliquot 
  of DNA, then transfer to a chilled cuvette.
    
- Electroporate each cuvette as follows:

  - Voltage: 2500 V
  - Capacitance: 25 uF
  - Resistance: 200 Ω
  - Gap length: 2 mm

  The Benatuil reference didn't specify a 
  resistance, so I took the 200 Ω parameter from 
  the preset S. cerevisiae protocol on the 
  electroporator.
  
- Immediately suspend the cells in 10 mL "recovery 
  media".  Prepare a 5x serial dilution to measure 
  transformation efficiency:

  - Pipet 40 μL YPD into each of 5 tubes.
  - Dilute 10 μL cells into the first tube and mix 
    well.
  - Continue the serial dilution by transferring
    10 μL each time.
  - Plate 20 μL of each dilution.
  - Incubate the plates at 30°C for 2-3 days.

- Incubate at 30°C for 1h with shaking at 225 rpm.

- Transfer to selective media and grow overnight.
